# Registering an rtk2go mount point

rtk2go is a free RTK "caster", which means it's its job to take the RTK corrections your base sends, and distribute them to rovers (tractors, combines etc). This way, your internet usage is minimal.

But we need to make a reservation, so do that [here](http://rtk2go.com/sample-page/new-reservation/).

Fill in the contact details, and I do suggest receiving the summary report (even tho I've never had one yet).

Pick a decent MountPt name. As the text suggests, don't go for "test" or "myublox" or "home" etc, but perhaps something relevant to the location you're in, the name of a local village or town etc.

You also want to pick a password, and if you don't, you'll be sent one to use instead. This is purely so nobody else can start sending corrections pretending to be your mount point.

Leave everything else at default, but put in a city and country.

Notice this bit at the bottom - you'll be sent a confirmation email which you have to reply to (don't have to say anything in it, just hit reply and Send) and then the reservation will be processed. You can use a temporary password until the point has become properly registered, and if you don't change it over at that point, then your site WILL be banned for a few hours until you resolve the issue.

With this in mind, I don't recommend enabling even on the temporary password UNTIL you have received confirmation that your mount point has been registered and should be using your proper password.

If you didn't get any emails, check your spam folder. Also, the mount point registration could take a few days, so be patient.
