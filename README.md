How to set up your own RTK base station

OK, about time I got writing this stuff down. This is from the point of view of someone who wishes to set up their own base station. It's a lot simpler than you might think, if you can get past the hurdle of finding stock that is...

Before you think about buying a base station kit tho, you need to consider:
- is it really necessary? Is there more than enough coverage in my area?
- do I know for a fact it will work with my vehicle?
  - at time of writing, this works with Case IH Trimble, FJ Dynamics, AgOpenGPS and (with a different [message set](messagesets.md)), John Deere. John Deere are a bit of a nightmare tho, they don't make life easy. Consider yourself warned there...

So, onto the steps then !

- (Maybe add in updating the ublox firmware here?)
- [How to configure the raspberry pi](PiConfiguration.md)
- Siting the antenna (tbc)
- configuring your location
- registering an rtk2go mount point
- entering the correct password
- [wait, message sets???](messagesets.md)
- publishing, and testing
- connecting your tractor
